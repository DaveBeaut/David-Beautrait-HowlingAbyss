    <h1>ABOUT</h1>

    <p>Welcome to our web application, a final year project aimed at homogenizing the level of play in ARAM matches of League of Legends. Our goal is to make ARAM matches more enjoyable and balanced for players of all skill levels.</p>

    <p>Our application offers a unique opportunity for League of Legends players to contribute to a community-driven database that defines the best items to purchase during a match. We believe that the key to success in any ARAM match is choosing the right items at the right time, and our application is designed to help players do just that.</p>

    <p>With our application, players can share their experiences and knowledge about which items work best in certain situations. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to the game, our application provides a centralized location for you to learn, contribute, and improve your gameplay.</p>

    <p>We understand that every player has their own playstyle and preferences, which is why our application allows users to input their own data based on their unique experiences. This data is compiled and analyzed to create a comprehensive database that reflects the most effective item choices for any given scenario.</p>

    <p>Our team is dedicated to making ARAM matches more fun and balanced for everyone, and we believe that our application has the potential to significantly improve the quality of play in ARAM matches. We invite you to join our community and contribute your own valuable insights to this project. Thank you for your interest and support, and we look forward to seeing you on the Rift!</p>
